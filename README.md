# Epicodus Intro to Programming Unit 3.3 Practice: Behavior-Driven Development

#### Final Project for Epicodus Unit Two, 01/16/2019 start date.

#### By **Robert James "Jimmy" Gore**

## Description

The primary purpose of this site is to demonstrate behavior-driven development using JavaScript and jQuery.  This repository contains two groups of code sets, the index group numbers of which are listed in the specs below.  The intent of these assignments will demonstrate how to establish various behaviors under specific sets of logic and inputs, such as those listed in the specs below.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Install Git Bash for Git repository cloning of the project
* Install Atom for review and edit of Code
* To access repository for project and review code, first clone repository at the appropriate link, then use Git Bash and/or Atom to open the project folder.
* GitHub Repository link is https://github.com/RJGore92/behavior-driven-development.

## Known Bugs

No known bugs are present in this project.

## Assignment Specs

### Index 1: Leap Year Detector:

#### Below are input examples for the Leap Year Detector assignment and their expected outputs.

* An input of 1993 should return false (years not divisible by 4 are not leap years).
* An input of 2004 should return true (years divisible by 4 (under most circumstances) are leap years).
* An input of 1900 should return false (years divisible by 100 (but not 400) are not leap years).
* An input of 2000 should return true (years divisible by 400 are leap years).

### Index 2: Pig Latin:

#### Below are input examples for the Pig Latin assignment and their expected outputs.

* An input of "anyone" should return "anyoneway" (words starting with vowels add "way" to the end).
* An input of "start" should return "artstay" (words beginning with consonants take the first sequence of consonants before the first vowel and move it to the end with an "ay" afterwards).
* An input of "square" should return "aresquay" (words that have a "qu" within the first set of consonants move the "qu" and any consonants before it to the end with an "ay" afterwards).
* An input of "youth" should return "outhyay" (words in Pig Latin treat the letter "y" as a consonant if it is the first letter in the word.)
* An input of "3" returns "3" (Pig Latin does not affect non-alphabetical characters.)
* An input of "A" returns "Aay" (Single-letter vowel words add "ay" at the end.)
